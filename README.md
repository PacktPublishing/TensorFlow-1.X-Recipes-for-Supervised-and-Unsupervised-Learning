TensorFlow 1.X Recipes for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Published by Packt
This is the code repository for [TensorFlow 1.X Recipes for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/tensorflow-1x-recipes-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788398756), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Deep Learning models often perform significantly better than traditional machine learning algorithms in many tasks. This course consists of hands-on recipes to use deep learning in the context of supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. 

After covering the basics of working with TensorFlow, it shows you how to perform the traditional machine learning tasks in supervised learning: regression and classification. This course also covers how to perform unsupervised learning using cutting-edge techniques from Deep Learning. 

To address many different use cases, this product presents recipes for both the low-level API (TensorFlow core) as well as the high-level APIs (tf.contrib.lean and Keras).
